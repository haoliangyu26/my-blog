Greetings and welcome to my blog! My name is Haoliang Yu, and I am currently an R&D engineer at [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/).

I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Texas at Dallas, and [my research](https://crm.utdallas.edu/haoliang-yu/) involves developing and applying multiphysics numerical methods to address interdisciplinary problems related to additive manufacturing (AM) and wind turbine aerodynamics.

At work, I develop commercial physics-based simulation software for AM processes, including the DED extension in [Ansys Mechanical](https://www.ansys.com/products/structures/ansys-mechanical) and a thermal solver for the LPBF process in [Ansys Additive](https://www.ansys.com/products/additive).

This blog serves as a place to document my personal learning progress or, sometimes, for simple note-taking. I hope you find something useful or interesting here.

Feel free to explore my blog, leave comments, and connect with me.
